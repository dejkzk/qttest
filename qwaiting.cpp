	Indicates that the widget is a window that should be decorated as a dialog (i.e., typically no maximize or minimize buttons in the title bar). This is the default type for QDialog. If you want to use it as a modal dialog, it should be launched from another window, or have a parent and used with the QWidget::windowModality property. If you make it modal, the dialog will prevent other top-level windows in the application from getting any input. We refer to a top-level window that has a parent as a secondary window.

	Produces a borderless window. The user cannot move or resize a borderless window via the window system. On X11, the result of the flag is dependent on the window manager and its ability to understand Motif and/or NETWM hints. Most existing modern window managers can handle this.

	The window is modal to a single window hierarchy and blocks input to its parent window, all grandparent windows, and all siblings of its parent and grandparent windows.
